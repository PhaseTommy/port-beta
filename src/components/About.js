            <p className='about-info'>I am a young, driven individual who is constantly learning and adapting in line with the ever-evolving field of user interface design and development. My journey started approximately 6 years ago when I first started creating social media graphics for influencers and professional players inside of the gaming community.

<br/><br/>I quickly outgrew this market and by the age of 18, I was commissioned for my first interface design project as a freelancer for a local design firm. This became a massive learning curve for me and ensured that I knew what I wanted to do as a career. 

<br/><br/>Since this point, I have continued to freelance and hone my skills on other global projects. It was approximately two years ago that I decided that I wanted to get into the development side of things. Initially, I learned basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and eventually ended up learning and mastering React JS, and Gatsby. 

<br/><br/>I am about to go into my third year of university at Sheffield Hallam specialising in UX in Graphic Design. In my spare time, I am a keen carp fisherman and I enjoy playing and watching Football</p>
